<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Sometimes all you want is to send a simple HTML email with a basic design.</p>
<h1>Really simple HTML email template</h1>
<p>This is a really simple email template. Its sole purpose is to get you to click the button below.</p>
<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
<p>All the information you need is on GitHub.</p>
<div style="font-size: 12px;margin: 24px 0;">
    Can you make it pop try a more powerful colour I got your invoice...it seems really high, why did you charge so much, and I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost. You might wanna give it another shot. Make it sexy we don't need a contract, do we nor just do what you think. I trust you, but remember, everything is the same or better or im not sure, try something else can you pimp this powerpoint, need more geometry patterns but we are a startup. I was wondering if my cat could be placed over the logo in the flyer it's great, can you add a beard though. I trust you make it look like Apple, so can you put "find us on facebook" by the facebook logo?
